## Background

###### In this assignment, you will put your ETL skills to the test. Many of Amazon's shoppers depend on product reviews to make a purchase.
###### Amazon makes these datasets publicly available. They are quite large and can exceed the capacity of local machines. One dataset alone contains 
###### over 1.5 million rows; with over 40 datasets, data analysis can be very demanding on the average local computer. Your first goal will be to
